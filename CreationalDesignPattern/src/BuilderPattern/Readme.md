The `Builder Design Pattern` in Java is a creational pattern that is used to construct complex objects step by step. The pattern is particularly useful when the object creation involves many optional parameters, or when the construction process of an object is complicated.

In contrast to the Factory Pattern (which deals with creating an object in a single step), the Builder Pattern allows for incremental construction of an object by setting various properties one at a time, making it more flexible and readable.

**Key Concepts of the Builder Pattern:**
- `Builder`: Defines the steps to create an object.
- `Concrete Builder`: Implements the steps defined by the builder to create and assemble the parts of the product.
- `Product`: The object that is being built.
- `Director`: Controls the construction process (optional, not always needed).

**When to Use the Builder Pattern:**
- When you need to create a complex object with many optional parameters.
- When the object construction needs to be flexible and readable.
- When the same construction process can create different representations.

**Example:**
Consider the example of building a House object. A house can have optional features like a garage, swimming pool, or garden. The Builder Pattern allows constructing the house step by step with these features.
